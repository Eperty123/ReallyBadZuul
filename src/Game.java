 * This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application.
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users
 * can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended
 * to make it more interesting!
 * <p>
 * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 * method.
 * <p>
 * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 * rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 * executes the commands that the parser returns.
